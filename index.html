		<h4>Tytu≈Ç - Run boy run</h4>
		<p>Run Boy Run! This world is not made for you
			Run Boy Run! They're trying to catch you
			Run Boy Run! Running is a victory
			Run Boy Run! Beauty lies behind the hills
			
			Run Boy Run! The sun will be guiding you
			Run Boy Run! They're trying to stop you
			Run Boy Run! This race is a prophecy
			Run Boy Run! Break out from society
			
			Tomorrow is another day
			And you won't have to hide away
			You'll be a Man, Boy!
			But for now it's time to Run, it's time to Run!
